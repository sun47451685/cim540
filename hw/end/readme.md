plan to use voice control/ soundlibrary
this is a speical clock APP since only you give the correct answer, it will stop.
it should work on your phone since everyone have it.

it should support both voice control (you tell the number on the screen)
and keyboard.

answer 3 questions wrong or do not give answer for 10 question will resect the clock
(the clock willnot stop)

PS:
still trying to find out how to connect the voice control API
so sound control is not available yet.
